# Hackathon Kit

This is a pretty sparse frontend setup for hackathons. It includes:

  - Backbone, jQuery, Underscore
  - less, css compilation
  - template compilation
  - js compilation

### Setup

1. Clone this repo and replace it's origin remote with `git remote rm origin && git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo-name>.git`.
2. Get ahold of npm somehow, and `npm install -g grunt` if you don't have it already.
3. `npm install`. We're only using npm to manage grunt at the moment, so this should be pretty light.
4. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and navigate to `localhost:8000`.
5. That's it :)
